title: Intro To Git

One of the first and most crucial skills that a developer needs to acquire is an understanding of version control.  As you learn to create websites, or more specifically in our case, Rails applications, it's important to maintain a proper workflow and to non-destructively make changes to your application.  Version control allows us to collaborate with our team members and create branches wherein we can edit and finalize changes before pushing them to the finished product.

The most popular way to manage our version control is with Git.  In simple terms, Git keeps track of changes you make to your project, and then when you tell it to, stores those changes.  Git also lets you make new branches off of your main line of work, and if you're happy with the branch, merge it in with the rest of the project.

The Git workflow has three basic steps:

1. Making changes to a file or files (Modifying).

2. Marking a file as ready to be stored (Staging).

3. Telling Git to store the changed file (Committing).

Once you understand this workflow - modify, stage, commit - Git will make much more sense, and then it will be just a matter of learning the simple commands we use to tell Git what we want it to do.  

This has been just a basic introduction to Git, but our next post will go into the specifics of initializing Git, staging our changes, and then committing them.
