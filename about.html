        <p class="text-faded">I am a self-motivated, hard worker looking for a position as a junior developer. I have a year of experience in coding and recently graduated from the DaVinci Coders Ruby on Rails program. I have knowledge of front-end and back-end languages and experience designing using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I am able to build applications “soup to nuts” and would be a valuable asset to any organization.</p>
